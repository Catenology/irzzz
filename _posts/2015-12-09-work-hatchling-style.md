### Description
Hatchling is a Content-View front end model that separates the content from the look and feel of your website. You can use Hatchling to build a CMS without a live database. Your website content is stored in a JSON document and will be injected into HTML at run time via AngularJS. This model allows you to work on content and on layout design separately. You can version control only your content or have multiple languages. You can easily add a product or project without duplicating extra code blocks. Your HTML code becomes simpler and DRYer. The name is inspired by "Chocobo Hatchling", a fictional creature from a video game franchise "Final Fantasy". "Hatchling" conveys the idea that in the given incubator you can create your very own single page and nurse it to change and grow with ease.
