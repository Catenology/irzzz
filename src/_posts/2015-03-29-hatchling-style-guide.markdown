### Description

Hatchling is a Content-View front end model that separates the content from the look and feel of your website. You can use Hatchling to build a CMS without a live database. Your website content is stored in a JSON document and will be injected into HTML at run time via AngularJS. The name is inspired by "Chocobo Hatchling", a fictional creature from a video game franchise "Final Fantasy". "Hatchling" conveys the idea that in the given incubator you can create your very own single page and nurse it to change and grow with ease.
