### Description

UW Libraries website is going through major changes as the current catalog system is soon to be replaced by a all-in-one system that is used by many other academic websites. In the past, many web usability issues have occurred and reported by UW libraries patrons regarding issues range widely across the website. The update of the catalog system is a great opportunity to upgrade and make changes to the current UW libraries website in order to solve numerous usability issues and to meet the information needs of the users. Since the change of the catalog will be impacting many user experience aspects, a re-design of the website can better help users to adapt to the changes. A website redesign that addresses those needs is critical to help the patrons to properly utilize the valuable resources that the UW Libraries provide.

### Solution

As an effort to improve the user experience of the UW Libraries website, this project will focus on solving usability issues that can better feed the information needs of the patrons and fit the information seeking behavior of the patrons. This project focuses on the following issues:

- Prioritized new homepage design with proper content
- Information Architecture
- Guides
- Library Mobile Website

The library system is under migration now and the new website will be launched in September, 2013. Below is the comparison between old and new homepage. (Now it has already been launched. Visit our new website at [University of Washington Library](http://www.lib.washington.edu/))
