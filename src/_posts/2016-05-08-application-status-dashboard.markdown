### Description

Application Status Dashboard is an initiave led by Infrastructure team aiming to modernize the way users get alerts on the applications status change. Traditionally the communication was handled by email alerts that users can opt-out. The launch of the dasboard transformed the opt-out to an opt-in format. Instead of telling us what they don't care about, users now can come to the site and let us know what they do care about by subscribing on specific applicaions. In addiotion, the site displays a summary of all applicaiton status, a color-coded real time status by application, and a timeline view (2-week span) of planned maintainance and outages. Admin group also has the option to send out alert for critical incidents. Key tasks being done include

- User interviews
- User flow
